# Health-monitoring-system-for-birds-using-iot-sensors
This is a prototype for a  low budget health monitoring system for birds which uses esp32 and IoT sensors to collect data and send a email notification for the user in case of any abnormalities in temperature and pulse of bird
This project uses thingspeak for data analysis and visualization in a graph form over time for continous monitoring of the data so that we can indetify diseas before it is fatal.
This project also uses a open library called "esp mail client" a open source library by mobitzz for email notification.
The sensors need to be calibrated. 
The hardware design need to be reduced and made even more smaller for affixing it with bird even more neatly without problems.
